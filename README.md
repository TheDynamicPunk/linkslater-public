# linkslater-public
You can find the live project on Heroku [here](https://linkslater.herokuapp.com/).

This is the public repo for Links Later project. The original project repository is private at the moment as there were some open source issues. It'll therefore be in private mode for sometime, so that I can work on fixing the issues and bring it back to the public domain.

Thanks for the support! â™¥

## About this project
This is my personal attempt to solve our problem of ever growing need to save and bring order to the chaotic world of internet. This project is at the very core, a link saving website, much like a bookmark facility in the browser, but with a much more intuitive UI. It just isn't good to look at, but functional as well! With features like link saving, product price tracking, mutli-device link sharing with user account personalisation etc, it brings new ways to consume content so that you never have to search for that cat video and pudding recipe on the internet when you decide to back to it.

It ultimately helps boost productivity by saving the links you want for later so that you can focus on the present, without missing your favourite content on the internet! I faced the same problem and with ever increasing memory consumption of our browsers we cannot have too many open links at once before they come back to haunt us in the form of slowdowns and sometime crashesðŸ˜ª

So save links for later in Links Later! ðŸ˜‰

## Contributing
Although contribution can be tough when the repository itself is not public, but I would encourage you to open issues for project improvement, suggesting features etc.and over time I can work behind the scenes to make it happen. So that whenever this project is back online it's even better than when we left it.

- Please head over to issues to create an issue, which will be discussed and added to the new-feature list.
- Also for the time being, pull requests to directly suggest a feature, by modifying the readme is welcome!
